# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 14, 2017

**Today's Goal:** Begin working on BroadCastReceiver to update RecyclerView when a page is updated.

**Thoughts:** I haven't worked with BroadCast Receivers in a long time. Had to get reacquainted by reading some documentation. 

**Today's Progress:** Restructured app to contain lists of pages in one central class implemented with Singleton pattern. BroadcastReceiver still needs to be completed.

**Next Day's Goal(s)** Finish building BroadcastReceiver and begin implementing JSOUP library

**Link to work:** [Updated App](https://github.com/jgarcia162/Updated)
